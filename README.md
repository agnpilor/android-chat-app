# ITAS 188 - Final Project - Angel Pilor

### What Features Weren't Working

-   When user sets a profile picture, the image isn't uploaded to Firebase Auth (might have something to do with the URI and how the image is stored)
-   When user clicks on another user to chat, the app crashes. Something to do with recycler view perhaps?
-   New user initially doesn't show up on other users list until after new user updates their profile(?)

### To Use the App

-   Need wifi for authentication
-   Need a valid phone number for the authentication

### Tutorials

### What Code Was My Own

-   Splash screen and implementing the gif was my main idea. (SplashScreen.Java)
-   OTPAuthentication.java was mainly from the tutorial and most of the classes were from the tutorial but since the tutorial is almost a year old some of the implementations and methods were deprecated and I had to change some stuff
