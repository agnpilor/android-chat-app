#ITAS 188 - Final Project - Angel Pilor

###What Features Weren't Working
- When user sets a profile picture, the image isn't uploaded to Firebase Auth (might have something to do with the URI and how the image is stored)
- When user clicks on another user to chat, the app crashes. Something to do with recycler view perhaps?
- New user initially doesn't show up on other users list until after new user updates their profile(?)

###To Use the App
- Need wifi for authentication 
- Need a valid phone number for the authetication

###Tutorials

###What Code Was My Own 

- Splash screen and implementing the gif was my main idea. (SplashScreen.Java)
- OTPAuthentication.java was mainly from the tutorial and most of the classes were from the tutorial but since the tutorial is almost a year old some of the implementations and methods were deprecated and I had to change some stuff
